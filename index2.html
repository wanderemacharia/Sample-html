<h1>INVICTUS by William Ernest Henley</h1>

<body>
<p>Out of the night that covers me,<br>
    Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
    I thank whatever gods may be <br>
    For my unconquerable soul. <br> </p>

<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>
    <em>I have not winced nor cried aloud. </em><br>
    Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>
    My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>

<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>
   Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>
   And yet the menace of the years <br>
   Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>

<p>It matters not how strait the gate, <br>
   How charged with punishments the scroll, <br>
  <strong>I am the master of my fate, <br>
   I am the captain of my soul.</p></strong>
